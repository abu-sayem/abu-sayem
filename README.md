I'm  architecting and building out systems with Python and Django. I have more than 2 years of experience developing and managing web applications using Django.

I am able to create and manage robust, performant, and scalable production systems from the beginning to deployment with following the best practices.

I am equally comfortable with both the client and server sides of web app development. I am proficient in building RESTful API web services. I have experience in Frontend framework Flutter React.js and Redux. 

Passionate about competitive Programming.Interested in devising better problem solving methods for challenging tasks and learning new technologies if needed arise.
